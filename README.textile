h2. A minimalist twitter clone written with "Sinatra":http://www.sinatrarb.com/ and "Authlogic":http://github.com/binarylogic/authlogic/tree/master

This project fullfills the need of a corporate "twitter":http://twitter.com/ web application for internal communication.

Due to our specific needs, it uses two different databases for authentication and for data: we want to use the mail credentials to log in, and those are stored into a _postfix_ database managed by the "postfixadmin":http://www.postfixadmin.org/ application.

I wrote the Sinatra adapter for authlogic and a Crypto provider that uses "facets":http://facets.rubyforge.org/' implementation of "MD5Crypt":http://www.usenix.org/events/usenix99/provos/provos_html/node10.html, because passwords are stored this way on our setup.

There is currently absolutely no styling or layout, only the bare application.

Feel free to fork the repository and use on your corporate network, thanks to authlogic you should be able to customize the authentication scheme easily.

<code>config.ru</code> for mod_passenger included.

Have fun!
